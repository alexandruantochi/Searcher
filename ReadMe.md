###Searcher Overview

This simple app allows you to search big text files that are impossible to read with normal applications like Microsoft Word or even WordPad.


###Features

* Fast Mode - when deactivated, it provides with a Progress Bar, but takes time to process the file; once it's deactivated, the processed file information is stored and activating it will not increase or decrease performance. Active by default.

* Search All - searches for all occurances in the file and displays them after reaching end of file; this is slower as it needs to go thorugh the whole file. Inactive by default.

* Show Time Elapsed - shows how much time in seconds it took to find the string occurance/all occurances. Active by default



###Installation

The source files and java Swing .iml are in the src folder. If you need to use the app, just download the .jar file from the Seacher_jar dir from [here](https://github.com/alexandruantochi/Searcher/blob/master/Searcher_jar/Searcher.jar?raw=true).
